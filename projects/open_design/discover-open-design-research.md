# Discover: Toy design research

This assignment will ask you to explore and explain some aspects the existing market for toys. To do this, first research toys on the Internet and in person at stores. You will create a presentation of your findings to help others understand how modular kits work. 

## Presentation

# Discover: Modular design research

This assignment asks you to look at objects not as whole "things," but rather as a sum of parts. It also asks you to consider the user experience of the person involved with building a "thing." To do this, explore and explain some aspects **modular design** by investigating why products and objects are designed and constructed the way they are. Areas of investigation could include architecture, engineering, product and furniture (industrial) design, and others. 

Find images of interesting or inspiring ways of making, attaching, and combining parts. You will create a presentation of your findings to help others understand how modular systems work.

## Instructions

1. Conduct desktop and field research of modular design. Investigate websites and physical stores that sell parts for modular objects and systems.
2. Produce the presentation according to the presentation requirements and export it to PDF format.

## Post work to the Studio as a PDF

Use the exact indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements.

# Discover: Resources

In this activity, you will be gathering information about the raw materials available to complete the project. Remember, the project brief mentioned that you have a budget between $0 and $10. Ideally, someone with limited financial resources should be able to reproduce your design. Please do not use combustable or explosive materials like matches, or materials that would most likely injure someone such as shards of glass or harmful chemicals. Safety first.

## Instructions

1. **Take Stock:** Photograph materials and objects from around your household or that you discard, or commonly acquire for free with other things that you buy. Of these materials, what might be useful?
2. **Local materials:** Go to a supermarket, hardware, craft supply store, or any other store that may have raw materials you can use. Photograph and document potential materials, objects, fasteners. Pay attention to the inexpensive or bulk products.

## Post work to the Studio

Use the exact indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements.

1. Upload 5 to 10 `.jpg` or `.png` photographs of materials. **Do not take screenshots or include images from websites. These materials should be local to you.**

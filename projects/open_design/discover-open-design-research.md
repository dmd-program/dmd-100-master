# Discover: Open design research

The Open Design Research presentation will allow you to get practical "primary" and "secondary" research experience. You will look at the kinds of toys currently on the market or from history, better understand concepts related to modularity, and to identify the free or low cost materials and resources available to you, enabling you to rapidly explore ideas in later steps of the project. You will then put this research into presentation slides to communicate your findings to others. 

### Instructions

1. Conduct primary (field, home) and secondary (library, Internet, etc. where you use other's work) research of toys.
   * Investigate websites that sell toys and visit physical toy and hobby stores.
3. Include primary and secondary research related to modular design
   * Conduct desktop and field research of modular design. Investigate websites and physical stores that sell parts for modular objects and systems.
4. Include primary research on resources available.
   * Do not include or use website screenshots, try to use only photos from your own visits to stores or from your home.
6. Produce the presentation according to the presentation requirements.
7. Inlcude any required links (IE - If Adobe Express is used) and also upload a PDF version.

### Toys: Primary and secondary research

You can begin this research looking at existing toys in your own home or online. Often, researching the history of the subject is the best starting point and helps you better understand how things became they way they are now. Keep in mind the questions listed in the slide requirements. What exactly are toys and what are they for? What toy categories did you find? You are also asked to identify your own categories. Essentially, this helps you create a taxonomy that gives a label to each category, which in turn helps you build a mental model for your own understanding, and helps those you are communicating with more easily understand your point of view.

### Modular design: Primary and secondary research

Begin by looking at objects not as whole "things," but rather as a sum of parts. It also asks you to consider the user experience of the person involved with building a "thing." To do this, explore and explain some aspects **modular design** by investigating why products and objects are designed and constructed the way they are. Areas of investigation could include architecture, engineering, product and furniture (industrial) design, and others. 

Find images of interesting or inspiring ways of making, attaching, and combining parts. You will create a presentation of your findings to help others understand how modular systems work.

### Resources: Primary research

In this activity, you will be gathering information about the raw materials available to complete the project. Remember, the project brief mentioned that you have a budget between $0 to $10. Ideally, someone with limited financial resources should be able to reproduce your design. Please do not use combustable or explosive materials like matches, or materials that would most likely injure someone such as shards of glass or harmful chemicals. Safety first.

## Research Presentation Slides

### Requirements

Please **use images as much as possible** to communicate your findings. You will produce a presentation with the following elements:

1. Title Page (1st slide)
   1. Open Design Research
   2. By: YOUR NAME 
   3. Date
2. Toy Design (5 - 10 slides)
   1. What exactly are toys and what are they for?
   2. What toy categories did you find? You can identify your own categories. Please include at least four categories.
      - Category name (you can invent this if there isn't a good one)
      - What materials are the toys made from?
      - Who are the intended users?
3. Modular Design (5 - 10 slides)
   1. What is "modular design"?
   2. What categories of modular design did you find? You can develop your own categories? Please include at least four categories.
      1. Category name (you can invent this if there isn't a good one)
      2. What are the affordances and benefits of this category?
      3. What are the drawbacks and limitations of this system?
      4. What materials could be used or substituted from your resources research? Include images from your resources discovery.
5. Resources (5-10 slides)
   1. **Take Stock:** Photograph materials and objects from around your household or that you discard, or commonly acquire for free with other things that you buy. Of these materials, what might be useful?
   2. **Local materials:** Go to a supermarket, hardware, craft supply store, or any other store that may have raw materials you can use. Photograph and document potential materials, objects, fasteners. Pay attention to the inexpensive or bulk products.
   3.  **Note:** Do not take screenshots or include images from websites. These materials should be local to you.

### Submit slides

1. Follow the submission instructions listed in Canvas.
2. Include a PDF version of the slides.

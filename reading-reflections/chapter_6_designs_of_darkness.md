# Designs of Darkness

## Prompt

In this chapter, Grudin makes a distinction between painting styles of Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill as well as the social design ideologies of Martin Heidegger and Sen no Rikyu. 

Can you identify contemporary people that may have similar contrasting design sensibilities? Their differences don't have to be political; artists and designers can have different sensibilities regarding cultural values, aesthetic taste, scale, technology, or other aspects of their work.

Compare two or more creators with divergent sensibilities on opposite extremes. Support your claims with vivid descriptions and cited facts.
